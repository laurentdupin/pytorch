# Vulkan Vision Owner Paths

## DAv2 One-Block Owner

The DAv2 benchmark can route one transformer block through
`vulkan_prepack::run_vision_backbone_block_context`. This backend-owned block
sees the qkv, proj, fc1, and fc2 packed contexts together while preserving the
current eager Vulkan math.

The first blocker for making this owner path clean was not the MLP handoff. It
was `aten::zero_` on byte buffers created during packed context setup. Those
zeros previously fell back to CPU because the Vulkan zero path only supported
float buffers. The byte-buffer shader zero path removes that fallback for the
owner setup tensors.

The owner path remains gated by the benchmark/runtime flags and should stay
separate from MLP scratch work. The next safe step after zero fallback is gone is
to implement the owned `fc1 -> GELU(out scratch) -> fc2` handoff inside this
owner, without aliasing clone outputs.
