# Vulkan Graph Evidence

`scripts/benchmarks/vulkan_graph_export_evidence.py` records a real external
model run through the checked-in `torch.vulkan.export_and_lower` executor. It
is a corpus harness, not a backend route: the model-specific construction and
input policy live in an external adapter.

The adapter is a callable specified as `MODULE:FACTORY` or `FILE.py:FACTORY`.
It receives `external_root` and `checkpoint` paths and returns a mapping with:

```python
{
    "model": model.eval(),
    "normal_inputs": (cpu_tensor,),
    "alternate_inputs": (cpu_tensor,),
    "dynamic_shapes": export_dynamic_shapes,
    "out_of_range_inputs": (cpu_tensor,),
}
```

`normal_inputs` and `alternate_inputs` must satisfy the same exported dynamic
guards. `out_of_range_inputs` is optional, but when supplied it must be
rejected by the exported guard. The harness runs CPU export, graph lowering,
eager Vulkan and CPU parity references, and a readback-separated repeated
graph reference run. It forces the remaining eager deferred canaries off for
the graph execution.

Some model frontends export a guard-specialized program even when the adapter
supplies a broader symbolic policy. If the normal program rejects the legal
alternate input at `_guards_fn`, the harness records that rejection and creates
one explicit export-and-lower guard variant for the alternate input. The result
is reported as `recompiled_guard_variant` with both program identities. This
is a graph-program cache variant, not a Vulkan exact-shape admission row. Any
other execution error remains a failure; the harness never uses CPU fallback.

Example:

```text
python scripts/benchmarks/vulkan_graph_export_evidence.py \
  --adapter C:\work\dav2_adapter.py:build \
  --external-root C:\external\Depth-Anything \
  --checkpoint C:\external\Depth-Anything\checkpoints\depth_anything_v2_vits.pth \
  --output-dir C:\results\dav2_vits_graph \
  --source-git-sha <full-HEAD-SHA> \
  --eager-atol 0.0 --eager-rtol 0.0 \
  --cpu-atol 0.002 --cpu-rtol 0.0
```

The caller-owned output directory receives measured census and parity
artifacts. The checked-in DAv2 and PaddleOCR evidence was deliberately
refreshed after the cleanup wave at source commit
`ec8e6a99995cbc9661b79aab488797b87f556a28`. The DAv2 census lowers all 12
`linear_gelu_none` candidates with no rejection; PaddleOCR remains the control
with no such candidates. Both corpora report zero unsupported nodes and zero
runtime CPU fallback, sync readback, or deferred-value creation. Future
measurements are caller-owned until they are deliberately reviewed and
replaced. The harness requires an explicit source SHA when `git` is not on
`PATH`, so a sanitized runtime cannot emit unproven provenance.

The machine-readable evidence records graph census and lowerings, guard
outcomes, program key, Vulkan runtime identity and DLL hashes, timing,
fallback/readback/deferred-value counters, and CPU/eager Vulkan parity. It
does not authorize model-name production dispatch, exact-shape admission, or
Python-executor performance tuning.

The default tolerances are zero. A nonzero tolerance is an explicit corpus
evidence choice and is written into the measured parity artifact. Graph versus
eager Vulkan should remain exact unless a documented backend precision contract
requires otherwise.

## GELU `none` precision contract

Eager Vulkan currently executes `aten::gelu(approximate="none")` with the tanh
kernel. A graph-owned `linear_gelu_none` region must therefore match eager
Vulkan exactly; it does not introduce a second approximation. Unit coverage
uses CPU tolerances of `atol=5e-4` and `rtol=5e-3` for this existing eager
kernel gap. The full DAv2 artifact retains its explicit corpus tolerance of
`atol=0.004`, `rtol=0.0` and records a maximum CPU difference of about
`0.00358`, while graph versus eager Vulkan remains exact. If eager Vulkan gains
true non-approximate GELU semantics, tighten this contract and refresh the
corpus evidence with the implementation change.
